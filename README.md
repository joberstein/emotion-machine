# Emotion Machine
An interactive experiment in relaxation created for my introduction to HTML class.

Feeling a little bored?  Try out my Emotion Machine!  Using CSS, I've created a website where, through a 
series of hovers and clicks, a user can experience shapes in a unique way and see fun animations play. The 
pastel color palette is even playful as well!
